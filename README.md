"# Mod12_A1_v2" 

For this project I utilized hand tracking using 4 hand poses (forward, backwards, turns, and teleportation), rather than controllers.
Hand tracking was a bit glitchy, which can be seen in the video. It was taking too much time to make it smoother and I already was running way behind.
