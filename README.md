The package file is quite large, so I had to upload it to Google Drive:

Info from the REASME file

For this project, I generated a maze using ProBuilder. For more fun, I covered the walls of the maze with the hedge prefabs. I used Quest Pro, which has pretty reasonable hand tracking. In order to run this app on the headset, under File, select Build And Run.Â  I hope it'll work on other Quest models.


The main poses:


1) To move forward: point your index forward


2) To move backwards: point your thumb backwards


3) To teleport: look at you open palm, then close it with the index finger pointing up. Move it around until you see the ray with a circle at the end of it. Teleportation will be triggered by "clicking" index and thumb fingers (only when the ray is white).


4) To turn: look at the palm, rotate it 90deg and then close it with the index finger pointing up. You should see two arrows over the index. Your hand in the direction where you would like to turn and then select it with index and thumb fingers.


In order to progress to the next level, you'll need to open the gate. For this, you should grab the keycard (blue rectangle next to the gate) with your left hand and "insert" it into the doorlock. Once the light on the doorlock turns green , let the card go, so it can attach to the slot. At this point, the gate should be opened.


Proceed towards the large cube with the stairs at the end of the maze. In order to finish the maze, you'll need to teleport to the teleportpoint (white disk) hoovering over the cube. It's a small point, so it creates a real challenge to get to the top of the cube. Once you achieve it, you should be showered with colorful confetti.


Here is the link to my video that will show these poses:
